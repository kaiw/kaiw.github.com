Quite a bit!

**File comparisons** are faster and interactivity is better while recomputing
changes, and initial support was added for comparing files using
synchronisation points.

**Folder comparisons** now have extra columns so you can see more file information
when doing your comparison. There is also a new shallow comparison option,
speeding things up nicely for people dealing with folders full of huge files.

**Version control view** has had some significant compatibility updates,
culminating in the death of the dreaded 'patch failed' dialog, as Meld now
uses more reliable ways of interacting with version control systems. Some big
updates went in to support more commands, give better feedback, and do a
better job of launching conflict comparisons.

**Meld** also received lots of little improvements here and there. We now have
better themeability (a big deal for dark theme fans), support for relaunching
recent comparisons, and a new UI for starting comparisons. Last but not least,
Meld's Windows support has improved, and bundled installers are becoming
available for Windows users (thanks to Keegan Witt).
