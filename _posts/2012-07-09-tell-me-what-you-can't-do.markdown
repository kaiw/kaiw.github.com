When writing Meld's [new documentation](http://meldmerge.org/help/), I added
a section that I wish every software project had:
["Things that Meld doesn't do"](http://meldmerge.org/help/missing-functionality.html).

Everyone's had the experience of spending hours trying to figure out how to
do &lt;insert task here&gt; with &lt;tool of choice&gt;, because *obviously*
&lt;tool of choice&gt; *must* be able to do &lt;insert task here&gt;. Many
years ago I remember trying to figure out how to create a histogram with
Excel---ludicrously obvious functionality for a spreadsheet---but at the time
it was all-but-impossible without a third-party commercial add-on.

If 'stuff we don't do' is documented at all, it's often relegated to a point in
the FAQ (e.g.,
[Gnumeric and pivot tables](http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/faq.shtml#6)),
which is okay as long as it shows up in a simple search. Ideally though, I feel
like software should do a better job of telling you both what it can do, and
what it can't.

Spending time only to find out that a tool can't solve your problem is an
incredibly frustrating experience.

Exposing your limitations might feel like bad marketing, but ultimately you'll
end up with fewer unhappy users.
