When I started maintaining Meld, a surprising number of accounts for new
<strike>chores</strike> services entered my life. Inevitably, a few
responsibilities were missed.

For example, until very recently, I didn't have admin access for the
[Meld mailing list](https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/meld-list).
Since all posts to the list by non-members are held for moderation, I'm pretty
sure that this means that all non-member list traffic over the last few years
has been dropped on the floor.

Whoops.

What's worse is that since I've started doing the moderation, there's been
a consistent trickle of messages needing approval. Meld's list doesn't exactly
have a lot of traffic, so an extra message every couple of days is a
significant boost.

...all of which makes me wonder just how many people didn't become involved
in Meld due to an unwatched moderation queue.
