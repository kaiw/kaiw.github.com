After an unexpectedly long transition, Meld 3.12 is the first stable release
of Meld based on GTK+ 3. As usual, plenty has changed. While a lot of work
this time around was behind the scenes, some of that work has enabled cool new
features as well.


Appearance
----------

Everything looks... newer. With the update to GTK+ 3, we've removed the use of
some older widgets&mdash;most notably the old-style file selectors&mdash;and
somewhat modernised the layout and overall visual appearance. We've also
cleaned up some icons to be a little more balanced, and updated the overall
colour scheme. While not ready yet, the next release cycle will also see
support for global dark theme settings.

Under GNOME Shell, Meld will integrate into the GNOME 3 style application
menu, and we'll fall back to adding a new "Meld" menu for other platforms.


Comparisons
-----------

Pane resizing&mdash;a long-standing feature request, finally picked up by
Marco Brito&mdash;has been merged. Hopefully this will make comparisons easier
for those of you who stuck trying to do a three-way merge on a 13" screen.

File comparisons now show a notification if a file is modified outside of
Meld, and prompt to reload. We also display better labels for file comparisons
launched from version control, so you should no longer see useless temporary
file names here.

In folder comparisons, if you have a folder that's empty after filtering has
been applied, that folder will (finally) be correctly trimmed from the tree.
We also now use normal desktop trash handling for file operations, instead of
just deleting things forever without warning...

On the version control side of things, we have some support for showing file
metadata, including renames thanks to Louis des Landes. Currently this is only
used by Bazaar, but we'll hopefully extend this support to Git and Mercurial
soon. Finally, as a handy touch, for conflict resolutions that you start from
a Meld version control tab, we now prompt to mark a conflict as resolved when
you close the file comparison.

Help and translation
--------------------

![Yelp browsing new Meld help](/assets/yelp-help.png)

Meld now uses Mallard for documentation, and there's a <strike>hack</strike>
script that we use to provide [online help](http://meldmerge.org/help/) for
non-GNOME platforms.

Thanks to the thoroughly awesome GNOME Translation Teams, Meld's translations
are [looking good](https://l10n.gnome.org/module/meld/), with several full
translations for the new manual as well! Of course, our translation coverage
could always be better, so if you notice gaps in your native language support,
please consider [joining a team](https://l10n.gnome.org/teams/) to help out.

Windows support
---------------

While Meld has worked on Windows for some time, we are now building and
distributing stand-alone Windows installers for Meld. Some of our Windows
support is still a little rough around the edges, but with more users and a
better distribution story, you can expect to see this situation continue to
improve in the coming release cycles. Thanks go to Keegan Witt for maintaining
the unofficial binary distribution, and for helping out with the transition.


Behind the scenes
-----------------

Meld is now a single-instance application, using the GtkApplication model. By
default Meld will still use multiple windows, and each command-line process
will wait until its window has closed, so from a user point of view, very
little should change.

With the transition to the newer GTK+ 3 platform and related tools, we've also
cleaned up tonnes of unpleasant code. Preferences handling has been rewritten,
our custom colours are CSS-themed and we've moved to making heavier use of the
excellent GtkSourceView library.


Future plans
------------

By the time you read this, 3.12 will probably have already branched, and some
pending stuff for 3.13 will be going in. My list of things-to-merge already
includes incremental find for file comparisons, better dark theme support, and
a rework of conflict resolution mode to show a combination of the pre-merged
file with ancestor information for conflicting sections.
